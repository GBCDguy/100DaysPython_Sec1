Day 2:
Today's Progress:
Today, I practiced basic Python concepts, including subscripting, string manipulation, working with integers, floats, and booleans. I also performed various mathematical operations and worked with the order of operations using PEMDAS. Additionally, I implemented a simple BMI calculator and learned how to round numbers in Python.

What I Learned:

Subscripting: Accessing individual characters from strings using positive and negative indexes.
Basic Data Types: Explored strings, integers, floats, and booleans, and how to manipulate them in Python.
Mathematical Operations: Practiced addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
BMI Calculator: Created a basic Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator using the formula BMI = weight / height^2.
Rounding: Learned how to round numbers using int(), round(), and specifying precision with round().
Assignment Operators: Practiced using assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= for updating variables.
Challenges:
No major challenges today, but I had to carefully follow the order of operations in some calculations.

Thoughts:
I found today's exercises useful in reinforcing my understanding of basic Python concepts, especially working with different data types and operators. Looking forward to building more complex programs as the days progress!
